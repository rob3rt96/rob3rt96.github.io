# Film Finder

## Description:

I created a **movie discovery** app that will recommend **random movies** by genre. 
Youâ€™ll be able to choose from several genres, and **like** or **dislike** a movie to get another suggestion.

## Technologies used:

For this app I used "**The Movie Database API**" of https://www.themoviedb.org/ to gather the genres of movies, and then to query the movies by genre.
