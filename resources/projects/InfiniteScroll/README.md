# Infinite Scroll

## Description:

I created a **photo displaying** app that will show and reload more pictures after you hit the bottom of the page. 
For this project I required knowledge about DOM, javascript fetch(), Promises, async/await, etc.

## Technologies used:

For this app I used "**Unsplash API**" of https://unsplash.com/documentation to gather the random photos, and then load them in the page.
